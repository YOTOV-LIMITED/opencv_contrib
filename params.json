  "body": "## Repository for OpenCV's extra modules\r\n\r\nThis repository is intended for development of so-called \"extra\" modules,\r\ncontributed functionality. New modules quite often do not have stable API,\r\nand they are not well-tested. Thus, they shouldn't be released as a part of\r\nofficial OpenCV distribution, since the library maintains binary compatibility,\r\nand tries to provide decent performance and stability.\r\n\r\nSo, all the new modules should be developed separately, and published in the\r\n`opencv_contrib` repository at first. Later, when the module matures and gains\r\npopularity, it is moved to the central OpenCV repository, and the development team\r\nprovides production quality support for this module.\r\n\r\n### How to build OpenCV with extra modules\r\n\r\nYou can build OpenCV, so it will include the modules from this repository.\r\nHere is the CMake command for you:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd <opencv_build_directory>\r\n$ cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<opencv_contrib>/modules <opencv_source_directory>\r\n$ make -j5\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the result, OpenCV will be built in the `<opencv_build_directory>` with all\r\nmodules from `opencv_contrib` repository. If you don't want all of the modules,\r\nuse CMake's `BUILD_opencv_*` options. Like in this example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<opencv_contrib>/modules -DBUILD_opencv_legacy=OFF <opencv_source_directory>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you prefer using the gui version of cmake (cmake-gui), then, you can add `opencv_contrib` modules within `opencv` core by doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. start cmake-gui\r\n\r\n2. select the opencv source code folder and the folder where binaries will be built (the 2 upper forms of the interface)\r\n\r\n3. press the `configure` button. you will see all the opencv build parameters in the central interface\r\n\r\n4. browse the parameters and look for the form called `OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH` (use the search form to focus rapidly on it)\r\n\r\n5. complete this `OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH` by the proper pathname to the `<opencv_contrib>/modules` value using its browse button.\r\n\r\n6. press the `configure` button followed by the `generate` button (the first time, you will be asked which makefile style to use)\r\n\r\n7. build the `opencv` core with the method you chose (make and make install if you chose Unix makfile at step 6) \r\n",
